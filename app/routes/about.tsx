            <PageTitle>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹</PageTitle>
            <p>Nice to meet you. I am Bhashkar.</p>
            <p>I am from ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³, currently living in ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª. Ich kann ein bisschen Deutsch sprechen.</p>
            <p>
                I spend way too much time in front of screens, either focusing on writing code or
                text; or relaxing by reading or watching anything that catches my fancy.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been professionally writing code for almost 13 years, for a variety of
                organizations, ranging from a 2-person startup running out of a living room, all the
                way up to companies which are market leaders in their field, with thousands of
                employees. I have worked across industries like online publishing, IoT, ad-tech,
                e-commerce, observability; and have built web frontends, backends, and native apps.
