                <p>
                    Hello and welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm a code wizard and tinkerer,
                    born in 🇮🇳 and currently residing in 🇩🇪. I speak a little bit of German, but
                    don't be too impressed. 😅
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not busy creating digital magic, you can find me reading, watching, or
                    just generally relaxing in front of a screen. It's a talent, I swear!
                </p>
                <p>
                    With almost 13 years of experience in the tech world, I've had the chance to
                    work for organizations ranging from 2-person startups to market leaders with
                    thousands of employees. I've built web frontends, backends, and native apps
                    across industries like online publishing, IoT, ad-tech, e-commerce, and
                    observability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride as you explore my portfolio. From code
                    to art, and everything in between, I promise to keep things interesting and fun.
                    And if you want to join in on the fun, feel free to connect with me on one of
                    the platforms below.

    );
}
