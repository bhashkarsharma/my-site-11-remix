                <PageTitle>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹</PageTitle>
                <p>Nice to meet you. I am Bhashkar.</p>
                <p>I am from ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³, currently living in ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª. Ich kann ein bisschen Deutsch sprechen.</p>
                <p>
                    I spend way too much time in front of screens, either focusing on writing code
                    or text; or relaxing by reading or watching anything that catches my fancy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been professionally writing code for almost 13 years, for a variety of
                    organizations, ranging from a 2-person startup running out of a living room, all
                    the way up to companies which are market leaders in their field, with thousands
                    of employees. I have worked across industries like online publishing, IoT,
                    ad-tech, e-commerce, observability; and have built web frontends, backends, and
                    native apps.
                </p>
